# Billionaires-Dataset-Excel-Analytics

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory Excel case study built around a global billionaires dataset. The objective is to analyze how wealth distribution varies across industries, age demographics, gender, and national population contexts. The exercises strengthen core Excel skills such as segmentation, pivot tables, calculated fields, ratio analysis, and comparative visualizations. All analytical questions mirror realistic tasks performed by business analysts and data analysts when profiling markets, high-value customer segments, or demographic economic behavior.

## Key Features

* Domain-focused exploration using real-world attributes: industry, age, country, gender, and net worth.
* Business questions rewritten to reflect meaningful analytical themes such as demographic behavior, concentration patterns, and macro-environment influences.
* Clear mapping between analytical questions and Excel solutions including aggregation, grouping, conditional logic, normalization, and comparative visualization.

Includes examples of:

* Custom segmentation (age banding using conditional formulas)
* Pivot-based aggregation and ratio calculations (wealth by industry and country)
* Normalized comparisons using country–population ratios
* Gender-based performance benchmarking
* Side-by-side charting for storytelling and insight presentation

## Dataset

This project uses a structured dataset representing a snapshot of the global billionaire population, including individual-level and macro-level attributes.

Key fields include:

* Person name, age, gender, industry, and self-made status
* Final net worth
* Country-level population, GDP, life expectancy, and tax rate

The dataset is intentionally kept wide rather than large so the focus remains on Excel reasoning, segmentation, and insight interpretation rather than data volume.

## How to Use

1. **Clone** this repository. or download the workbook in Excel format.
2. **Review the core dataset** tab containing raw attributes.
3. **Explore the pivot table worksheets** to understand segmentation models and aggregation logic.
4. Review supporting **calculated columns** for:
   * Age banding
   * Normalized billionaire concentration per population
   * Percentage and average comparisons
5. **Extend the analysis** by creating additional pivots, calculated fields, or visual layers based on new questions (industry rank, country rank, outlier detection, etc.).
6. **Present insights** using clustered columns, stacked distributions, and ratio-based charts to **support business storytelling**.

## Insights You Can Find

* **Industry analytics**

  * Total billionaire wealth by industry and average net worth per billionaire
  * Identification of industries with concentrated wealth and dominant contributors

* **Demographics and self-made profiles**

  * Age-based segmentation showing count distribution and self-made prevalence
  * Average wealth differences across age groups and experience levels

* **Population-normalized concentration**

  * Billionaire density per country adjusted for national population
  * Identification of markets where entrepreneurial or financial ecosystems are disproportionately conducive to high-net-worth success

* **Gender-based benchmarking**

  * Average net worth comparison by gender
  * Self-made distribution and demographic age differences between male and female billionaire segments

These exercises simulate real analytical workflows used for demographic profiling, market sizing, economic storytelling, and comparative financial interpretation.
